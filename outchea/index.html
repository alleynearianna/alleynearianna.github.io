			<p class="bodytext"> My name is Arianna Alleyne, a New York City woman with a little more to her than subway stops and Times Square. I identify as a future entrepreneur balancing business calls and flights while eating french fries in Europe and I’ve never felt more myself. People look at me and say, “Wow, you don’t look like you are majoring in Computer Programming and Software Engineering,” due to my creative, fashion-forward outlook on the world. In this step of my career, I am pushing myself to see the world as more than just 0’s and 1’s. By incorporating many travel experiences into my academic career, I have broadened the horizons of my mind and the span of my impact.</p>

		<p class="tipmeaning1">don’t be afraid to go far and wide! Always take the adventurous route! I climbed all the way up to the top of this palace in Portugal, getting lost many times in the process not aware there was a bus but it made the view worth it!</p>

		<p class="tipmeaning2">you may be wondering where I got this amazing pasta with truffle oil.. Italy maybe? NOPE! I actually got this in Barcelona and it is by far, without a doubt the best I’ve ever had at this small mom and pop restaurant. I expected to be eating paella all weekend but that was not the case!</p>

		<div class="tip3"></div>
		<div class="tipbackground3"></div>
		<p class="tipmeaning3">months before I take my next trip, I always look for my favorite music artists abroad. The tickets are always a fraction of the price compared to America and you get the opportunity to be very close as most venues are standing room only. I’ve had the opportunity to see some of my favorite performers such as J. Cole, Bas, Chance The Rapper, Logic and many more! </p>

		<blockquote class="tiptitle4">let your inner american shine</blockquote>
		<div class="tip4"></div>
		<div class="tipbackground4"></div>
		<p class="tipmeaning4">trust me, you don’t look like a local. They can spot, smell, and even feel the “American” aura from miles away. If I had a euro for everytime someone referred to me as “America” or “New York” while I was abroad, I would have enough to pick up and move there! Take this as an opportunity to make this a cultural experience for locals as well. Take them to Starbucks during pumpkin spice season, teach them some popular words, and let them know that there is more to us than the Kardashians!</p>

		<blockquote class="tiptitle5">find travel budddies</blockquote>
		<div class="tipbackground5"></div>
		<p class="tipmeaning5">I was given the rare opportunity to travel with my friends. We share similar goals and interests which allows us to travel seamlessly together. It is so much better than traveling alone because it is cheaper where accomodations are concerned and who else is going to take all your Instagram pictures?</p>
